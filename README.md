Hi there üñêÔ∏è , here there are some of the projects I did work for:
#### Twitter Project 1
For this project I have been asked to collect Twitter data using twarc in order to find out which was the most popular language in the dataset and also to calculate the average, minimum and maximum number of followers that users in the dataset have.

The most popular language in the dataset was English and the average number of followers of the users was 29.5K, the minumum number of followers was 0 and the max was 8.5 million.üí™

#### Twitter Project 2
This was another challenge of Twitter project 1. I have been asked to answer the following question: to what extent does the sentiment expressed in a tweet influence user engagement with the tweet (likes and retweets)?

A Sentiment Analysis has been performed (on Azure) on the Tweets. The dataset extracted has been merged witht the original dataset and consequently analysed: as a result, the average number of times that a Tweet has been retweetted or liked was higher when the sentiment expressed in a Tweet was Positive rather than Negative or Neutral sentiment. The positive sentiment expressed in a Tweets positively influence user engagment.üëå

#### Twitter Project 3
As a conclusion of the Twetter venture, I have been asked to perform some Automated Content Analysis on the Twetter data in order to analyse and estimate how many of the users were possibly willing to participate to a fundrising campaign organised by the ONG at the base of this project.

The results of the Automated Content Analysis showed that 10 tweets out of 110 were referring to the 50th anniversary of the company, about 9.1%. Instead, 9 tweets out of 110 were referring to a fundrising or supportive-related topic, about 8.1%. The data of the two variables have been merged in a third variable, namely "possible_targets", showing that out of a sample of 110 tweets 17 are referred to enthusiastic users who were mentioning the ONG anniversary or either topics which can be in favour of a fundrising campaign, about the 15.5%. The results show that a possible 15.5% of users among the social medis followers of ONG could be targeted by the fundrising campaign since they would be presumably willing to support the campaign, although, the sample is too small to accurately predict the final result. Considering the whole amount of social media followers of the ONG (31 millions), if a 15.5% would approximately contribute to the fundrising campaign with 1 dollar,an estimation of the result of the Fundraising Campaign can be deducted to 4.805.000,00 $. üëÄ
