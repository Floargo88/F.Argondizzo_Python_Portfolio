# F.Argondizzo_Python_Portfolio
Here there are some of the projects I did work for. To face the challenges requested I had to perform some data exploration, data cleaning, merging datasets together, sentiment score calculation, categorization, tokenization, data visualization, statistical modelling, predictive analysis, machine learning and model performances evaluation.
#### Twitter Project 1
For this project I have been asked to collect Twitter data using twarc in order to find out which was the most popular language in the dataset and also to calculate the average, minimum and maximum number of followers that users in the dataset have.

The most popular language in the dataset was English and the average number of followers of the users was 29.5K, the minumum number of followers was 0 and the max was 8.5 million.
